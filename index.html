  <h1>Sure you're eco friendly,</h1>
  <h1>But is your wardrobe?</h1>
  <p>You’re shopping and your eye crosses paths with that ~perfect~ pair of shoes. And we mean perfect. The ones you swear you need, that are just too trendy to pass up. What’s the harm in adding some new kicks to your wardrobe, right? While many of us care about the environment and aim to lead lives that reflect this, the fashion industry often gets overlooked when considering environmental impact. </p>
  <p>With the rise of “fast-fashion,” our marketplace thrives off of rapidly producing inexpensive clothing in response to the latest trends. There’s no regard for materials used in production, the amount of waste and pollutants produced, or the deforestation that occurs as a result.</p>
  <p>So, does this mean you can’t get that perfect pair of shoes? Not exactly. Consider buying durable items, wearing them regularly before donating, or buying secondhand. Discover what impact your wardrobe is making, and learn how to reduce your fashion footprint from personalized approaches that will work for you.</p>
